# Bacteria to Beef

## Purpose ##

The purpose of this challenge was to identify the top 10 bacterial species in the belly buttons of volunteers.  We first made a drop down menu showing the demographic information of the person based on their respective index number.

## Deliverable 1 (Bar Chart Creation) ##

The bar chart shows the top 10 bacterial specimens (OTU as they are known for this project) for each person when selecting a volunteer's index number.

## Deliverable 2 (Bubble Chart Creation ##

To serve as a compliment to the Bar Chart, a bubble chart's purpose is to express quantity within a specific value, with respect to the rest of the sample or samples.

## Deliverable 3 (Gauge Chart Creation) ##

The Guage Chart deliverable displays the weekly frequency, and displays the value from a scale of 0 to 10.  
The drop down updates all dependent charts simultaneously.
